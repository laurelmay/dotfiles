# This playbook configures ZSH with the configuration files placed in {{ zdot_dir }} while a
# ~/.local/share/zsh is created to store history. The configured ~/.zshenv will set ZDOTDIR to
# {{ zdot_dir }}. While this isn't totally perfect, it helps clean up some of the mess in $HOME
# that would be typical in a ZSH configuration. It also makes it a bit easier to break the
# configuration into multiple files rather than having everything in one giant rc file. All files
# are created as symlinks which hopefully makes it easier to track changes.
